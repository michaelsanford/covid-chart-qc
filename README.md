# COVID 19 Charting for QuÃ©bec

Pandas experiment to chart some COVID data.

## Kaggle

This was ported [to Kaggle as a Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelsanford/covid-explorer-quebec), which was maintained until SRC deprecated their data source and stopped updating it on 9 Aptil 2022. This project is now archived.

## Quickstart

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
```

## What is this?

A silly late-night experiment with Pandas to make my own charts.

Probably don't use it for anything serious.

## Data Source?

This scrapes the publically-available (but undocumented) SRC data source.

(Thank you for making it public ðŸ’–)
